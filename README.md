## Cost Metrics
### The Total Supply Chain Cost

  Based on the dashboard insights, here are some optimization strategies to reduce the total supply chain cost:

#### Optimize Shipping Costs
Negotiate Better Carrier Rates: Work with multiple carriers and negotiate volume-based discounts.

Leverage Regional Fulfillment Centers: Reduce last-mile delivery costs by shipping from locations closer to customers.

Use Hybrid Shipping Methods: Combine ground and air shipping to balance speed and cost efficiency.

Optimize Packaging: Reduce dimensional weight charges by using the smallest possible packaging that protects the product.

#### Reduce Handling and Extra Fees
Automate Fulfillment Processes: Use warehouse automation (e.g., conveyor systems, barcode scanning) to reduce labor costs.

Optimize Warehouse Layout: Minimize picking and packing time by reorganizing inventory based on order frequency.

Reduce Returns and Reprocessing Fees: Improve quality control and packaging to minimize damage-related returns.

## Efficiency Metrics

#### Improve Order Efficiency
Increase On-Time Delivery (42.51%): Work with reliable logistics partners and improve demand forecasting to prevent delays.

Improve the Complete Order Rate (32.96%): Address inventory shortages and reduce order processing time.

Boost Perfect Order Rate (14.01%): Reduce order errors, damaged goods, and shipping mistakes.
